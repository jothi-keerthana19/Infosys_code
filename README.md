LightGBM Model for Classification
Overview:

This project demonstrates how to train a LightGBM model for classification tasks. It includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, evaluation using cross-validation, and model performance metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve).
The trained model is saved using joblib for future use.
