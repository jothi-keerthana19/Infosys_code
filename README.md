🚀 AI Predictive Models for Credit Underwriting


Hello! Welcome to the project repository for AI Predictive Models for Credit Underwriting.
Empowering financial institutions with advanced AI-driven insights to enhance credit underwriting efficiency and accuracy.

📜 Overview

This project is the culmination of my passion for leveraging machine learning to solve real-world problems. By applying predictive modeling to credit underwriting, I aimed to streamline risk assessment processes, enhance decision-making accuracy, and reduce manual effort for financial institutions. Throughout this journey, I acquired hands-on experience in end-to-end project development, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment.

🛠️ About

This project combines machine learning and intuitive design to:
- **Predict Credit Risk**: Implement models that forecast the likelihood of defaults.
- **Enhance Data Insights**: Provide a deeper understanding of financial patterns through analytics.
- **Scalable Solutions**: Facilitate integration with real-world systems for automated decision-making.

It was developed as part of my academic and personal learning journey, offering insights into building impactful AI solutions for the financial sector.

🌟 Features

- **Dual Application Interfaces**:
  - Flask-based web app for traditional user experiences.
  - Streamlit dashboard for user-friendly and interactive predictions.
- **Advanced Preprocessing**:
  - Log transformations and categorical encodings for robust input handling.
- **Built-in ML Models**:
  - Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and more.

💻 Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
  - flask, streamlit

⚙️ Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jothi-keerthana19/Infosys_code.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Infosys_code
   ```
3. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Mac/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

🔄 Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and prepare the dataset.
   - Handle missing values using imputation.
   - Apply feature scaling and encode categorical variables.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Training**:
   - Train models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks.
   - Optimize hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
   - Save the trained model as a serialized file (e.g., `model.pkl`).
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Use metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Generate confusion matrices.
4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the trained model via Flask and Streamlit interfaces.

🛠️ Usage

1. **Run the Flask Application:**
   ```bash
   python Flask_app.py
   ```
   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

2. **Run the Streamlit Dashboard:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run st_app.py
   ```

📈 Results

- **Model Performance**: Evaluate predictions using confusion matrices and accuracy metrics.
- **Scalable Framework**: Easily adaptable to integrate with other credit underwriting systems.
